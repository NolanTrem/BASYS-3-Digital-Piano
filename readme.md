Using the Basys 3 board, VHDL code can be written to play a song on a digital piano. There are numerous approaches to produce this output; however, by utilizing the clock cycles on the board, one can create a simple loop that plays a given note after a certain amount of time. This process was used to play the piano introduction to Kanye Westâ€™s Runaway.

Future implementations of this project could include:
- expanding the lenght of the song played
- Finding a more intuitive way to denote the note played and its length
